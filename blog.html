                    <h5 class="card-title">What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">DOM stands for Document Object Model, which is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the HTML or XML document as a tree structure, where each node in the tree corresponds to a part of the document, such as an element, attribute, or text node.
                            <br><br>
                        The purpose of the DOM is to provide a way for programs to access and manipulate the content and structure of a web page. It allows web developers to dynamically update the content of a page without reloading the entire page. For example, a web page might have a button that, when clicked, triggers a JavaScript function to modify the content of the page. The DOM provides a way for the JavaScript code to access and modify the HTML elements on the page.
                                <br><br>
                        In addition to manipulating the content of a page, the DOM also provides a way for programs to handle user input, respond to events, and create animations and other dynamic effects. Overall, the DOM is a powerful tool for creating interactive and responsive web applications.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">To select HTML elements using the DOM, there are several methods available. Here are some of the most commonly used DOM methods for selecting elements:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>getElementById()</li>
                        <li>getElementsByClassName()</li>
                        <li>getElementsByTagName()</li>
                        <li>querySelector()</li>
                        <li>querySelectorAll()</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5 class="card-title">What is event bubble?</h5>
                    <p class="card-text"> Event bubbling is a mechanism in which an event that is triggered on an element is propagated up the DOM tree, from the target element to its parent elements, all the way up to the document object.
                        <br><br>
                        When an event is triggered on an element, it first fires on the element itself, then bubbles up to its parent elements in the DOM tree until it reaches the document object. This can have implications for how the event is handled, particularly if multiple event handlers are attached to different elements along the bubbling path.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">In programming, a callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed by that function at a certain point in its execution. The purpose of a callback function is to allow the caller function to execute some code or perform some action after the execution of the called function is complete.</p>
